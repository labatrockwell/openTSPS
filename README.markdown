About
------------
TSPS is a toolkit for sensing people in spaces meant for both prototyping and permanent installations. 
It uses openCV to analyze a camera, kinect, or video data, and sends what it finds via OSC, TCP, TUIO, or Websockets.
There are example TSPS clients in Processing, Javascript, Flash, Quartz composer, and many others!

Downloads
------------
Because of the now defunct Github downloads, TSPS downloads are hosted at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tsps/files/)

Installing:
------------

* Mac OS X - 10.6+
  * web camera, video files, or Kinect: 
    * download and extract openTSPS_1.3_mac.zip
    * run openTSPS/openTSPS.app
  * ASUS Xtion
    * download and extract openTSPS_1.3_openNI_mac.zip
    * install drivers (thanks to James George for this tip):
      * easiest way is to use the package from Sensecast [http://sensecast.com/files/Sensecast.and.Libs.Installer.v.0.02.dmg](http://sensecast.com/files/Sensecast.and.Libs.Installer.v.0.02.dmg)   

* Windows
  * Tested with Windows 7 
  * web camera, video files: 
    * download and extract openTSPS_1.3_win.zip
    * run openTSPS.exe
  * Kinect
    * download and extract openTSPS_1.3_win.zip
    * plug in your kinect
    * manually install drivers from openTSPS/drivers/Kinect
    * run openTSPS/openTSPS.exe

* All platforms
  * make sure to keep the "data" folder next to your app if you move it!  

Compiling:
------------
1. clone openframeworks from here: [https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks )
2. clone the TSPS directory into openframeworks/
3. clone all submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
4. open the project for your platform (Xcode of vs2010) in openTSPS/standalone/basic
5. compile and run!

Compiling OS X 10.7+:
------------
To use the video settings feature with openFrameworks, you must compile against OS X 10.6. If you don't need 
the video settings, change the Base SDK in the openTSPS project and openFrameworks project to "Latest SDK".

To compile against 10.6, follow the steps laid out in this [forum post](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,10343.0.html)

Build Script
------------
* (OS X) - You can alternately build all of the binaries, the Processing library, and zip up all examples by running the build script
   * cd /Directory/of/openTSPS/build
   * bash build.sh VERSION_NUMBER (e.g. 1.3)
   * this will place 4 zip files in openTSPS/releases
   * note: you must have Xcode installed for this to work!

Troubleshooting
------------
* If you have trouble compiling, experience crashes, or need any general help, please visit the [TSPS Forum](http://opentsps.com/forum)

WebSockets
------------
* To turn on WebSocket communication (on by default in 1.1), select the Communication panel in the GUI and edit the WebSockets panel at the very bottom.
* To test your WebSocket, simply compile/run openTSPS, then navigate your browser to localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port that is specified in the GUI. By default it's localhost:7681.
* To have extra fun, open that same URL in a bunch of browser windows.
* To have the most fun, open up another computer to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT
* Making your own JS TSPS clients is easy (and they don't have to live in the bin/data/web directory); the TSPS WebSocket sender sends JSON, so you don't even have to use our JS files if you don't want to.
